# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024 – Practice Repo

This repository is where I'm casually practising **Advent of Code 2024** problems.  
I'm not going day-by-day like the real event — this is just a place to experiment, learn,  
and solve random puzzles whenever I feel like it.

Still new to competitive programming, so the solutions might be messy, slow, or incomplete.  
That’s the whole point of this repo: try stuff, break stuff, learn stuff.

## 📁 Current Progress

Right now I only have:

- **Day 21 — WIP** (yep, I started with a hard one...)

More days will appear here eventually, but in no particular order.  
Just whatever I feel like solving on that day.
